              Using a list containing all the selected colours, after having their Saturation
              and variance constrained, where a colour may be repeated if it occurs multiple times,
              generate an approximate average colour using monte carlo. This is taken by assigning
              to each pixel a random colour selected from the list of all colours that have
              been previously chosen. Given the size of the sample space, greater than 1 million
              pixels, the approximation of the average will be very close to the actual average
              colour.

              Draw to the screen all the information that has thus been generated. This
              includes the canvas with a representation of the average colour, the bucket
              colours and their associated percentages, as well as a list containing the
              previous 5 colours that have been selected. This helps communicate the data
              and analysis therein but what is left is a title. That last is up to you to
              do, to find the the best title for one of the visualizations.

              While the data is still in HSV, count up how many of each hue exists. Since
              hue varies through a range of 360, there are that many possible hues that
              could exist. Break the 360 value colour wheel into 18 40 value sections. group
              each colour into it's respective "bucket" and compute how much each bucket is
              represented as a share of the total colours selected.
