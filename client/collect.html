        <p>
          After data is received, convert it from the standard RGB into HSV, an encoding
          much better suited to our needs. Once done, we can constrain the <em>Saturation</em> and
          <em>Value</em> fields, leaving only the <em>Hue</em> to vary. Finally, the new
          colour needs to be converted back to RGB to be displayed in browser.

  <!-- <h2 class="heading">3. Exploratory Analysis: Visualize for Analysis.  </h2>
  <p>
    While the data is still in HSV, count up how many of each hue exists. Since
    hue varies through a range of 360, there are that many possible hues that
    could exist. Break the 360 value colour wheel into 18 40 value sections. group
    each colour into it's respective "bucket" and compute how much each bucket is
    represented as a share of the total colours selected.
  </p>
  <h2 class="heading">4. Statistical & Computational Analysis: Compute Average Using Monte Carlo. </h2>
  <p>
    Using a list containing all the selected colours, after having their Saturation
    and variance constrained, where a colour may be repeated if it occurs multiple times,
    generate an approximate average colour using monte carlo. This is taken by assigning
    to each pixel a random colour selected from the list of all colours that have
    been previously chosen. Given the size of the sample space, greater than 1 million
    pixels, the approximation of the average will be very close to the actual average
    colour.
  </p>
  <h2 class="heading">5. Presenting: Visualize Colour Selections.</h2>
  <p>
    Draw to the screen all the information that has thus been generated. This
    includes the canvas with a representation of the average colour, the bucket
    colours and their associated percentages, as well as a list containing the
    previous 5 colours that have been selected. This helps communicate the data
    and analysis therein but what is left is a title. That last is up to you to
    do, to find the the best title for one of the visualizations.
